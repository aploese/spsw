/**
 * The interface for accessing a serial port.
 *
 * Port means a serial device like UART, usb to serial converter or even a TCP
 * bridge to an serial device on a different machine. Due to the fact that a
 * character her can have 5,6,7 or 8 data bits, don't confuse characters with
 * bytes, see {@link DataBits} for more details. If you work wit 8 data bytes
 * characters and bytes have the same length.
 *
 * A implementing class should check permissions with a SecurityManager. It is
 * desired to check fail-fast in the constructor. The {@link FileOutputStream}
 * should be the blueprint.<br>
 * Checking of the closed state should be done lazily to improve performance.
 * The implementations are not required to be thread save.<br>
 * Closing a port with blocked read or write operation should unblock the
 * pending read/write and throw a
 * {@code InterruptedIOException(SerialPortSocket.PORT_IS_CLOSED)} in the Thread
 * of that read/write.<br>
 * It is desired to close any OS resources in an finalizer. This is to to
 * prevent blocked ports in larger systems. A call to the garbage collector can
 * then free the still claimed resources.
 *
 * The meaning of the signal lines (RTS/CTS...) is viewn from this point. There
 * are two general cable configurations used with the RS-232C Communications
 * Standard:
 * <li>Data Terminal Equipment (DTE): IBM PC's, printers, plotters, etc <br>
 * </li>
 * <li>Data Communication Equipment (DCE): modems, multiplexors, etc</li> <br>
